#
# Welcome to your new system for filing users' spam automatically into
# a fixed mailbox name on an IMAP mail server, dependent on their domain.
#
# This is dependent on the presence of the Perl module Mail::IMAPClient.
# The easiest way to install this is using CPAN. You can do this by typing
# the following commands, saying "no" when it asks you if you want to do a
# full manual configuration of the CPAN configuration.
#
#      perl -MCPAN -e shell
#      install Mail::IMAPClient
#      quit
#
# The IMAPspam.pm file should then be placed in the directory
#      /usr/lib/MailScanner/MailScanner/CustomFunctions/
# on your Linux system, or in the appropriate CustomFunctions directory on
# your other Unix-like system.
#
# The IMAPspam.conf file should be placed in the directory
#      /etc/MailScanner/
# on your Linux system, or in the appropriate MailScanner configuration
# directory on your other Unix-like system.
#
# To make use of the system, you also need to change 2 lines in your
# MailScanner.conf file. The settings are

Spam Actions              = &IMAPspam('/etc/MailScanner/IMAPspam.conf')
High Scoring Spam Actions = &IMAPspam('/etc/MailScanner/IMAPspam.conf')

# You will then obviously need to restart MailScanner on the system, with
# the command
#      service MailScanner restart
# or other command appropriate to your system.
#
# Read the IMAPspam.conf file for more details on the structure of this
# configuration file and how to set it all up correctly.
#
# Any problems, call Steve Swaney and he will pass the information onto me.
#
# Regards,
# Julian Field.
